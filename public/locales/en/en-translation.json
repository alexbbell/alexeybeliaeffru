        "description": "I work as a full-stack software developer and have a wide experience of creating and maintaining IT systems. Most of all I use C#, JavaScript, Rest API, Rabbit Mq. With C# I mean Net (.NetFramework, Net Core, EF Core, Nlog, NewtonSoft, OpenXML). JavaScript is not only a native language, but also TypeScript and the React library. I also created several simple tools with NodeJS, so JavaScript is not only for frontend.",

        "about": "I started to learn the development since my high school, it was the “Basic”. And then I realized that I want to be a software developer. When I was a student, I spent a lot of time to learn the development and soon I could find my first work. It was RBC (RosBusinessConsulting) – one of the best economic media in Russia. Since that time I always learn new technologies, add and improve my skills, read and listen to IT publics.\n I have been happily married for almost 20 years, we have three great children. The elder one has a big talent in mathematics and programming, he is one of the strongest schoolchildren in Moscow in these subjects. He regularly wins prizes at various competitions. My daughter is a very creative person who, in addition to school, has achieved great success in dancing, drawing, design and other creative fields. The youngest is all three and he is just a favorite of the whole family. \n In addition to family and work, sports occupies a significant place in my life. I am fond of running (jogging) and have successfully completed several full marathons (42.2km). I also like music and gardening. I love to travel and communicate with new people, I easily find a common language with them, easily change the environment and open up to new things with pleasure.",
